# InfectedFrontierVR - WIP

Infected Frontier is a project started as a work for a subject that requires to do a game with VR mode, multiplayer online (between 1-3 players) including
IA and VFX synchronization.

I will post the build of the alpha in itch.io soon but, by the moment you can download it cloning this repository and opening it with Unity 2021.3.10f1

My work here was mainly the netcode the player setting (movement in VR with physics and the interaction with objects). That's a work in progress planned to be a
zombies game with components of storytelling and arcade too.
